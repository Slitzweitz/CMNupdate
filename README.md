# CMNupdate
Simple Powershell script to update the version of an important file at work, changes text in each doc in a given folder

First, you should put all CMN templates into a folder on your C:\ drive named 'test', as that is where the program will look.

Next, open up Windows PowerShell and paste the code (right click). Then hold Shift and press Enter. The code will begin to run. It will only update the text used in the $FindText and $ReplaceWith variables, so change them as necessary.

Will need to run once for the liability portion and once for the revision #. 

ALWAYS KEEP A COPY OF YOUR ORIGNINAL FILES SEPARATE.
